# Plain LSTM 640×360 Baseline Experiment Hypothesis

## Experiment ID: plain_lstm_640x360_baseline
Date: 2025-07-24
Researcher: Claude Code Assistant
Phase: Phase 1 - Plain LSTM Implementation (RVT Paper Validation)

## Background

Previous RVT experiments have consistently shown a "complexity paradox":
- **10 previous experiments failed**: All sophisticated approaches (4-scale FPN, attention mechanisms, size-aware loss) performed worse than simple baselines
- **3-scale baseline performance**: 34.02% overall mAP, 17.28% small objects mAP
- **Small object detection challenge**: Consistent underperformance in classes 2,3,4 (Motorcycle, Bicycle, Pedestrian)
- **Resolution limitation hypothesis**: 640×360 may be fundamentally insufficient for small object detection

## Primary Hypothesis

**"RVT Paper's Plain LSTM (1×1 convolution) will outperform the current DWSConvLSTM2d baseline while providing the foundation for progressive resolution training to achieve significant small object detection improvements."**

## Theoretical Foundation

### 1. RVT Paper Validation (Messikommer et al.)

#### Core Claims from RVT Paper:
- **Performance**: Plain LSTM achieves **+1.1% mAP improvement** over ConvLSTM variants
- **Efficiency**: **~50% parameter reduction** through architectural simplification
- **Simplicity**: 1×1 convolution eliminates unnecessary complexity of depthwise-separable convolutions

#### Mathematical Foundation:
```
Plain LSTM Gates:
- Input Transform:  x_t → 1×1 Conv → [i_t, f_t, g_t, o_t]
- Hidden Transform: h_{t-1} → 1×1 Conv → [i_t, f_t, g_t, o_t]

vs

DWSConvLSTM Gates:
- Complex Transform: [x_t, h_{t-1}] → 3×3 DWS Conv → [i_t, f_t, g_t, o_t]
```

#### Expected Advantages:
1. **Reduced Parameter Count**: Simpler 1×1 operations vs complex 3×3 depthwise-separable
2. **Better Gradient Flow**: Direct connections improve backpropagation efficiency  
3. **Training Stability**: Less complex optimization landscape
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Lower computational overhead

### 2. Small Object Detection Foundation

#### Current Challenges:
- **Classes 2,3,4 Underperformance**: Motorcycle (16K instances), Bicycle (1K instances), Pedestrian (8K instances)
- **Resolution Limitation**: 640×360 provides insufficient detail for small objects
- **Complexity Paradox**: All enhancement attempts failed, suggesting need for solid foundation

#### Plain LSTM as Foundation:
- **Stable Base Architecture**: Proven performance improvement from RVT paper
- **Progressive Training Ready**: Simpler architecture easier to scale to high resolution
- **Memory Efficient**: Essential for 1280×720 training in Phase 2

### 3. Architecture Simplification Benefits

#### Complexity Reduction:
```python
# Current: DWSConvLSTM2d
class DWSConvLSTM2d:
    conv1x1 = Conv2d(dim, dim*4, 1)  # Initial transform
    dws_conv = DepthwiseSeparableConv(...)  # Complex operation
    
# Proposed: PlainLSTM2d  
class PlainLSTM2d:
    input_transform = Conv2d(dim, dim*4, 1, bias=True)   # Simple
    hidden_transform = Conv2d(dim, dim*4, 1, bias=False) # Direct
```

#### Predicted Benefits:
1. **Training Speed**: Faster iteration cycles (target: >4.5 it/s)
2. **Convergence Quality**: Smoother loss curves, fewer local minima
3. **Scalability**: Better performance at higher resolutions in Phase 2

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Quantitative Expectations (640×360 Resolution)

#### Based on RVT Paper Claims:

- **Parameter Reduction**: ~50% fewer parameters vs DWSConvLSTM2d
- **Training Efficiency**: 10-20% faster training speed

#### Conservative Estimates:
- **Minimum Overall mAP**: 33.5% (must not degrade significantly)
- **Minimum Small Objects mAP**: 16.5% (acceptable for Phase 1 foundation)
- **Training Stability**: Smooth convergence within 100K steps

### Qualitative Expectations

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 Implementation Approach

class PlainLSTM2d(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim: int, cell_update_dropout: float = 0.0):
        # RVT paper specification: 1×1 convolutions only
        self.input_transform = Conv2d(dim, dim*4, 1, bias=True)
        self.hidden_transform = Conv2d(dim, dim*4, 1, bias=False)
```

## Conclusion

This experiment represents a critical foundation-laying phase for enhanced small object detection. By implementing and validating the RVT paper's Plain LSTM approach, we establish both:

1. **A proven base architecture** with theoretical and empirical support
2. **A simplified, scalable foundation** for progressive resolution training

The hypothesis is grounded in solid theoretical work (RVT paper) while addressing the practical constraints observed in previous experiments. Success here enables confident progression to Phase 2's ambitious small object detection goals (25%+ mAP at 1280×720).

The "simplicity first" approach directly addresses the complexity paradox observed in previous experiments, providing the stable foundation necessary for the challenging progressive training experiments ahead.
