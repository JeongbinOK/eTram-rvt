However, the persistent decline in small object detection performance (-3.75% vs baseline) despite targeted weighting reveals that size-aware loss alone is insufficient to address fundamental small object detection challenges. The results establish a definitive performance ceiling for the current approach and highlight the need for alternative strategies that address root causes rather than training methodologies.",
