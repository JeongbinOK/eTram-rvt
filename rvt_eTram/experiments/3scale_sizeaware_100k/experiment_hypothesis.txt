3-scale FPN + Size-aware Loss Experiment - Hypothesis and Expected Outcomes
=====================================================================

Experiment ID: 3scale_sizeaware_100k
Date: 2025-07-10
Research Question: Can size-aware loss achieve optimal small object detection when combined with stable 3-scale FPN?

===============================
1. CORE RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS
===============================

1.1. Primary Hypothesis
-----------------------
"The combination of stable 3-scale FPN architecture with size-aware loss weighting will achieve optimal small object detection performance, significantly outperforming all previous experiments."

1.2. Supporting Hypotheses
-------------------------
H1: 3-scale FPN provides stable, noise-free feature representation
H2: Size-aware loss will effectively rebalance training toward small objects
H3: The combination eliminates both architectural instability and training imbalance
H4: Pure size-aware effect will be clearly measurable and significant

===============================
2. MOTIVATION AND RATIONALE
===============================

2.1. Previous Experiment Analysis
---------------------------------
Baseline 3-scale FPN:
✅ Strengths: Stable training, good overall performance (34.02% mAP)
❌ Weakness: Suboptimal small object detection (17.28% mAP)

Failed 4-scale FPN:
❌ Architecture: P1 features caused performance degradation (30.93% mAP)
❌ Small objects: Worse than baseline (14.83% mAP)

4-scale + Size-aware:
✅ Training: Stable convergence with size-aware loss
⚠️ Performance: Partial recovery (32.23% mAP) but still below baseline
❌ Small objects: Still below baseline (12.75% mAP)

2.2. Strategic Insight
---------------------
Key realization: **Architectural complexity (P1) masked size-aware loss benefits**

Solution: Use proven 3-scale architecture + size-aware loss to isolate and maximize the weighting effect without architectural interference.

===============================
3. TECHNICAL HYPOTHESIS
===============================

3.1. Size-aware Loss Mechanism
-----------------------------
Mathematical formulation:
```
weight(A) = 2.5 × exp(-A / 1024)
weight_final = clamp(weight, 1.0, 2.5)

where A = object_area = width × height
```

Predicted weight distribution:
- 16×16 motorcycle: weight = 1.94 (94% boost)
- 20×20 bicycle: weight = 1.68 (68% boost)  
- 24×24 pedestrian: weight = 1.51 (51% boost)
- 64×64 car: weight = 1.0 (no change)

3.2. Training Dynamics Prediction
--------------------------------
Before (uniform weighting):
```
Total_loss = IoU_loss_large_objects + IoU_loss_small_objects
Gradient_flow ≈ 80% large objects, 20% small objects
```

After (size-aware weighting):
```
Total_loss = IoU_loss_large_objects + (IoU_loss_small_objects × weight)
Gradient_flow ≈ 50% large objects, 50% small objects
```

Expected result: **Balanced training attention** leading to improved small object detection.

3.3. Feature Utilization Hypothesis
----------------------------------
3-scale FPN features (P2, P3, P4):
- P2 (stride 8): High-resolution features for small objects, **noise-free**
- P3 (stride 16): Medium-resolution for medium objects
- P4 (stride 32): Low-resolution for large objects

Size-aware loss effect on P2 features:
- Enhanced gradient flow → better P2 feature learning
- Improved small object localization → higher precision
- Reduced false negatives → better recall

4.3. Metric Distribution Predictions
