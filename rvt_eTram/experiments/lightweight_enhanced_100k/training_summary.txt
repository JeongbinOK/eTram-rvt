LIGHTWEIGHT ENHANCED CONVLSTM EXPERIMENT SUMMARY
=================================================

Experiment ID: lightweight_enhanced_100k
Date Completed: 2025-07-24
Training Duration: ~6 hours (100,000 steps)
WandB ID: w84mdkns

ARCHITECTURE DETAILS:
- Base: 3-scale FPN with MaxViT backbone
- Enhancement: LightweightEnhancedConvLSTM at P2 stage only
- Parameter Overhead: 14.7% (minimal compared to other failed experiments)
- Key Features:
  * Temporal attention for small objects (enhancement_ratio=0.05)
  * Event-density adaptive processing (small_object_threshold=0.3)
  * Sparse event region identification and enhancement

PERFORMANCE RESULTS:
==================
Overall mAP: 20.93% (vs 34.02% baseline = -13.09% degradation)
AP50: 47.9%
AP75: 14.6%
Small Objects mAP: 5.4% (vs 17.28% baseline = -11.88% degradation)
Medium Objects mAP: 23.6%
Large Objects mAP: 37.7%

EXPERIMENT RANKING: 8th out of 10 experiments (2nd worst performance)

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
=================
1. SEVERE PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION: Despite minimal 14.7% parameter increase, 
   overall performance dropped by 13.09% - confirming complexity paradox

2. SMALL OBJECT DETECTION FAILURE: The primary target (small objects) showed 
   worst degradation: 17.28% → 5.4% (-68.7% relative decrease)

3. TEMPORAL ATTENTION FAILURE: Attention mechanisms designed for small objects 
   appear to interfere with feature extraction in event-based context

4. EVENT-DENSITY PROCESSING INEFFECTIVE: Adaptive processing based on event density 
   did not provide expected benefits for sparse regions

FAILURE ANALYSIS:
================
Primary Causes:
- Overfitting due to increased model complexity on small dataset
- Inappropriate attention design for temporal event sequences
- Enhancement parameters not optimized for 640×360 resolution constraints
- Interference between temporal modeling and spatial feature extraction

Technical Issues:
- Enhanced ConvLSTM created gradient flow problems
- Temporal attention weights may have caused feature suppression
- Event-density estimation created additional computational overhead without benefits

LESSONS LEARNED:
===============
1. Even "lightweight" enhancements (14.7% parameters) can cause severe degradation
2. Event-based data requires fundamentally different enhancement strategies than traditional vision
3. Temporal attention mechanisms need careful architectural integration
4. Resolution constraints (640×360) limit effectiveness of any feature enhancement
5. Complexity paradox is REAL and consistent across all enhancement attempts

RECOMMENDATIONS:
===============
IMMEDIATE: Stop all architectural enhancement attempts for current resolution
SHORT-TERM: Prioritize resolution increase experiments (640×360 → 1280×720)
LONG-TERM: Focus on data-centric improvements rather than model architecture changes
