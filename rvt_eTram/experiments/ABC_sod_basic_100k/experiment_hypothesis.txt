======================================

Date: 2025-07-16
Experiment ID: ABC_sod_basic_100k
Model: ABC (Auxiliary Balanced Classifier) for Small Object Detection

HYPOTHESIS:
Auxiliary Balanced Classifier (ABC) approach will significantly improve small object detection performance by combining main detection head with auxiliary small object detector specialized for high-resolution features.

THEORETICAL FOUNDATION:

1. **Auxiliary Detection Principle:**
   - Main YOLOX Head: Handles all objects across all scales (P1, P2, P3, P4)
   - Auxiliary Small Object Detector: Specializes in small objects (Motorcycle, Bicycle, Pedestrian) on high-resolution scales (P1, P2)
   - Multi-task learning enhances feature representation for small objects

2. **Balanced Training Strategy:**
   - Main detection loss weight: 1.0 (standard detection for all objects)
   - Auxiliary detection loss weight: 2.0 (enhanced focus on small objects)
   - Small object classes: [2, 3, 4] (Motorcycle, Bicycle, Pedestrian)
   - Balanced training addresses class imbalance problem

3. **Enhanced Feature Processing:**
   - Additional convolution layers in auxiliary detector for small object feature enhancement
   - High-resolution feature maps (P1: stride 4, P2: stride 8) provide better spatial resolution
   - Cross-scale feature sharing between main and auxiliary detectors

4. **Size-Aware Loss Integration:**
   - Main head uses size-aware loss (exponential weighting, weight=2.0)
   - Auxiliary head focuses specifically on small objects with enhanced loss
   - Combined loss function: Total = 1.0 × Main + 2.0 × Auxiliary

ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN:

```
Event Data → MaxViT+LSTM → 4-Scale FPN → Main YOLOX Head (All objects, All scales)
                                      → Auxiliary SOD Head (Small objects, P1+P2 only)
                                      → Multi-task ABC Loss
```

**Key Components:**
- **Main Head**: Standard YOLOX detection on all 4 scales
- **Auxiliary Head**: Small object detection on P1, P2 scales with enhanced features
- **ABC Loss**: Balanced combination of main and auxiliary losses

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:

**Primary Goals:**
- Small objects AP: >20% (vs 17.28% baseline) - +15% improvement
- Overall mAP: >36% (vs 34.02% baseline) - +5% improvement
- Balanced detection across all object sizes

**Performance Breakdown:**
- Motorcycle (class 2): Significant improvement expected
- Bicycle (class 3): Significant improvement expected  
- Pedestrian (class 4): Significant improvement expected
- Other classes: Maintain or slight improvement

COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS:

**vs Baseline (3-scale FPN):**
- Better small object detection through auxiliary detector
- Enhanced feature processing for high-resolution scales
- Balanced training strategy

**vs patch_size=2 experiment:**
- More stable training (patch_size=4 vs patch_size=2)
- Better memory efficiency (batch_size=6 vs batch_size=2)
- Focused approach on detection task rather than architecture changes

TRAINING CONFIGURATION:

- **Architecture**: patch_size=4 + 4-scale FPN + ABC Head
- **Training Steps**: 100,000 (faster iteration for ABC validation)
- **Batch Size**: 6 (expected stable with patch_size=4)
- **Loss Weighting**: Main=1.0, Auxiliary=2.0
- **Small Object Classes**: [2, 3, 4] (Motorcycle, Bicycle, Pedestrian)
- **Auxiliary Scales**: [0, 1] (P1, P2 - stride 4, 8)

RISKS AND MITIGATION:

**Potential Risks:**
- Increased model complexity may slow training
- Auxiliary detector may interfere with main detector performance
- Memory usage increase due to dual detection heads

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Careful loss weighting to balance main and auxiliary tasks
- Efficient auxiliary detector design (only 2 scales vs 4)
- Memory optimization through enhanced feature sharing

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

**Must Achieve:**
- Small objects AP > 19% (vs 17.28% baseline)
- Overall mAP > 35% (vs 34.02% baseline)
- Stable training convergence (final loss < 3.5)

**Target Achievement:**
- Small objects AP > 20% (+15% improvement)
- Overall mAP > 36% (+5% improvement)
- Maintained performance on medium/large objects

**Breakthrough Achievement:**
- Small objects AP > 22% (+25% improvement)
- Overall mAP > 38% (+10% improvement)
- Balanced detection across all object sizes

INNOVATION ASPECTS:

1. **First ABC implementation for event-based object detection**
2. **Specialized auxiliary detector for small objects**
3. **Multi-task learning approach for detection**
4. **High-resolution feature enhancement for small objects**
5. **Balanced training strategy for class imbalance**

This experiment represents a significant advancement in small object detection for event-based vision systems, combining the strengths of multi-task learning with specialized auxiliary detection.
