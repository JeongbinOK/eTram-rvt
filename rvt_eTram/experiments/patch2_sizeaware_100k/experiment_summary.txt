Patch Size 2 + Size-aware Loss Experiment Summary
================================================

Experiment: patch2_sizeaware_100k
Date: 2025-07-15
Status: Training Completed, Validation Issues

===========================================
MAIN FINDINGS
===========================================

❌ PERFORMANCE CONCERN:
- Final validation AP: 15.64% (significantly below baseline ~34% mAP)
- Performance gap: -18.38% vs baseline
- Requires investigation into root causes

⚠️ MEMORY IMPACT:
- patch_size=2 increased memory usage dramatically
- Required batch_size reduction: 6 → 2
- May have affected training stability and final performance

✅ TRAINING STABILITY:
- Successfully completed 100,000 steps
- Stable convergence with final loss: 5.18
- Training speed: 5.43 it/s

===========================================
TECHNICAL CHALLENGES
===========================================

1. CHECKPOINT COMPATIBILITY:
   - Trained model incompatible with standard validation configs
   - patch_size=2 creates different architecture dimensions
   - Need custom validation setup

2. MEMORY CONSTRAINTS:
   - CUDA OOM with standard batch sizes
   - Small batch_size may negatively impact performance
   - Need memory optimization strategies

===========================================
KEY CONFIGURATION
===========================================

Model Architecture:
- Backbone: MaxViTRNN with patch_size=2
- FPN: 3-scale (P2, P3, P4) → effective strides 2, 4, 8
- Head: YoloX with size-aware loss (weight=2.0)

Training Settings:
- Steps: 100,000
- Batch size: 2 (reduced from 6 due to memory)
- Dataset: etram_cls8_sample (8 classes)
- Classes: Car, Truck, Motorcycle, Bicycle, Pedestrian, Bus, Static, Other

===========================================
ANALYSIS & NEXT STEPS
===========================================

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Fix validation setup for patch_size=2 model
2. Get detailed performance metrics
3. Compare with baseline performance

INVESTIGATION NEEDED:
- Why performance is significantly lower than baseline
- Impact of batch_size reduction on training dynamics
- Whether patch_size=2 is optimal for small object detection

ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
- Data-driven threshold tuning (proceed with this)
- ABC-based auxiliary classifier approach
- Memory optimization techniques

===========================================
EXPERIMENT CONCLUSION
===========================================

The patch_size=2 experiment revealed important insights:

POSITIVE:
- Training completed successfully
- Stable convergence achieved
- Memory constraints identified and managed

NEGATIVE:
- Performance significantly below expectations
- Validation setup issues
- Memory limitations may have impacted results

RECOMMENDATION:
- Continue with data-driven threshold tuning
- Investigate memory optimization
- Consider alternative small object detection approaches

This experiment demonstrates that simply reducing patch_size may not be 
the optimal approach for small object detection improvement.
