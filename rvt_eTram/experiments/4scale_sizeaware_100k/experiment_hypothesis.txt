Size-aware Loss Function Experiment - Hypothesis and Expected Outcomes
=====================================================================

Experiment ID: 4scale_sizeaware_100k
Date: 2025-07-10
Research Question: Can size-aware loss weighting solve the 4-scale FPN performance degradation?

===============================
1. RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS
===============================

1.1. Primary Hypothesis
-----------------------
"Size-aware loss weighting will enable 4-scale FPN to effectively utilize P1 features for small object detection, resulting in improved performance over both 3-scale baseline and failed 4-scale FPN experiments."

1.2. Supporting Hypotheses
-------------------------
H1: P1 features contain valuable information for small objects but are overwhelmed by noise
H2: Standard loss weighting underemphasizes small objects during training
H3: Exponential size weighting will focus training on hard small object examples
H4: The combination of high-resolution features + targeted training will synergize

===============================
2. PROBLEM ANALYSIS
===============================

2.1. Previous Experiment Failure Analysis
-----------------------------------------
4-scale FPN (Previous Results):
- Overall mAP: 34.02% → 30.93% (-3.09%) ❌
- Small objects: 17.28% → 14.83% (-2.45%) ❌
- All metrics decreased despite architectural improvement

Root Cause Analysis:
1. Training Imbalance: Small objects contribute less to total loss
2. Noise Dominance: P1 features contain high-frequency noise
3. Gradient Dynamics: Large objects dominate gradient updates
4. Learning Strategy: Same training approach not optimal for larger model

2.2. Current Approach Rationale
------------------------------
Size-aware loss addresses root causes:
- Rebalances training focus toward small objects
- Amplifies small object gradient contributions
- Provides adaptive weighting based on object difficulty
- Maintains architectural benefits while fixing training issues

===============================
3. TECHNICAL HYPOTHESIS
===============================

3.1. Size-aware Loss Mechanism
-----------------------------
Weight Formula: w = α * exp(-area / threshold)
Where: α = size_aware_weight (2.5), threshold = small_threshold (1024)

Expected Behavior:
- 16x16 object: w = 2.5 * exp(-256/1024) = 1.94 (strong boost)
- 32x32 object: w = 2.5 * exp(-1024/1024) = 0.92 → 1.0 (clamped)
- 64x64 object: w = 1.0 (standard weight)

3.2. Training Dynamic Changes
----------------------------
Before (Standard Loss):
- Large objects: High absolute loss contribution
- Small objects: Low absolute loss contribution
- Gradient flow: Dominated by large objects

After (Size-aware Loss):
- Large objects: Standard loss contribution
- Small objects: Amplified loss contribution (up to 2.5x)
- Gradient flow: Balanced between object sizes

3.3. Feature Utilization Hypothesis
----------------------------------
P1 Features (stride 4):
- Contain high-resolution spatial information
- Crucial for small object localization
- Previously underutilized due to training imbalance

Expected Improvement:
- Size-aware loss will force model to learn from P1 features
- High-resolution information will be properly weighted
- Small object detection will improve significantly

===============================
4. PERFORMANCE PREDICTIONS
===============================

4.1. Quantitative Targets
-------------------------
Primary Metrics:
- Small Objects mAP: 17.28% → 20-25% (+15-45% improvement)
- Overall mAP: 34.02% → 36-38% (+5-10% improvement)
- AP50: 67.03% → 70%+ (+3-5% improvement)

Class-specific Improvements:
- Motorcycle (class 2): Most benefit from P1 features
- Bicycle (class 3): Significant improvement expected
- Pedestrian (class 4): Moderate improvement expected

4.2. Qualitative Improvements
----------------------------
- Better localization of small objects
- Reduced false negatives for small classes
- More confident predictions for small objects
- Improved recall for distant objects

4.3. Comparison with Baselines
-----------------------------
vs 3-scale Baseline (34.02% mAP):
- Expected: 2-4% improvement
- Rationale: Size-aware loss + architectural benefits

vs 4-scale FPN Failed (30.93% mAP):
- Expected: 5-7% improvement
- Rationale: Training strategy fixes architectural benefits

===============================
5. RISK ANALYSIS
===============================
