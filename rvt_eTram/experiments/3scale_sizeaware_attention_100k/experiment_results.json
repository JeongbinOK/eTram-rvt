  "conclusion": "This experiment demonstrates that sophisticated attention mechanisms, while technically implementable, can significantly degrade performance when applied to low-resolution event-based object detection. The 24.7% mAP result (vs 34.08% baseline) represents a critical failure that validates the importance of resolution over architectural complexity for small object detection. The negative result provides valuable insights: (1) attention mechanisms require sufficient spatial resolution to be effective, (2) complex architectures can cause overfitting even with apparent training stability, and (3) the proven 3-scale + size-aware architecture represents a local optimum that is difficult to improve through additional complexity. Future work should prioritize resolution increase (1280×720) over architectural enhancements.",
