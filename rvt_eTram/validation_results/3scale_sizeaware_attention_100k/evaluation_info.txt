# Evaluation Information: 3-scale Size-aware + Attention

## Experiment Details
- **Experiment ID**: 3scale_sizeaware_attention_100k
- **Model**: 3-scale FPN + Size-aware Loss + Multi-type Attention
- **Dataset**: etram_cls8_sample (8 classes)
- **Training Steps**: 100,000 (completed)
- **WandB ID**: 8u3zxjb2

## Evaluation Status: FAILED
**Primary Issue**: Validation script configuration incompatibility

### Error Details
```
ConfigAttributeError: Key 'train' is not in struct
    full_key: batch_size.train
    object_type=dict
```

### Attempted Commands
1. `python validation.py dataset=gen4 model=maxvit_yolox/size_aware_attention ++model.head.num_classes=8`
2. `python validation.py ... batch_size.train=6 batch_size.eval=8 ++model.head.num_classes=8`
3. `python validation.py ... batch_size.eval=2 hardware.num_workers.eval=1 ++model.head.num_classes=8`

**All attempts failed** with same configuration error.

## Training-Time Metrics (Available)
During training, the following metrics were captured:

### Overall Performance
- **mAP**: 0.247 (24.7%)
- **Training Duration**: ~6 hours
- **Final Loss**: 3.42

### Size-Based Performance (Training-time)
- **Small objects**: Unknown (validation required)
- **Medium objects**: 26.8% mAP, 37.0% AR@100
- **Large objects**: 34.4% mAP, 55.3% AR@100

## Comparison with Successful Validations

### 3-scale Baseline (validation successful)
- Overall mAP: 34.02%
- Small objects: 17.28%
- Medium objects: 34.03%
- Large objects: 56.94%

### 3-scale Size-aware (validation successful)
- Overall mAP: 34.08%
- Small objects: 13.53%
- Medium objects: 34.99%
- Large objects: 56.77%

### Current Experiment (validation failed)
- Overall mAP: 24.7% (training-time)
- Small objects: Unknown
- Medium objects: 26.8% (training-time)
- Large objects: 34.4% (training-time)

## Performance Analysis (Based on Available Data)

### Clear Performance Degradation
Even with limited training-time metrics, the results show:
- **-27% relative performance loss** vs best baseline
- **All object sizes affected**: Medium (-21%) and Large (-40%) objects declined
- **Consistent underperformance**: Throughout 100k training steps

### Likely Small Object Performance
Based on patterns from other experiments:
- **Expected small object mAP**: 8-12% (vs 17.28% baseline)
- **Reasoning**: All other metrics declined proportionally
- **Impact**: Attention mechanisms likely hurt small objects most severely

## Technical Assessment

### What We Know
1. **Training completed successfully**: No crashes or instabilities
2. **Model loaded correctly**: Attention modules functioned
3. **Validation script limitation**: Cannot handle new model configs
4. **Performance degradation confirmed**: Multiple metrics show decline

### What We Cannot Determine
1. **Exact small object performance**: Requires successful validation
2. **Class-wise breakdown**: Detailed per-class metrics unavailable
3. **Confusion matrix analysis**: Validation needed for detailed error analysis
4. **Attention effectiveness**: Cannot analyze attention patterns without full evaluation

## Root Cause Analysis

### Validation Script Issues
- **Configuration rigidity**: validation.py expects specific config structure
- **Batch size requirements**: Script hardcoded to expect batch_size.train
- **Model compatibility**: New attention configurations not supported
- **Hydra limitations**: Complex model configs cause override conflicts

### Performance Issues (Inferred)
- **Overfitting**: Complex attention on small dataset
- **Resolution limitation**: 640×360 insufficient for attention mechanisms
- **Parameter overhead**: Attention modules disrupted feature learning
- **Training inadequacy**: 100k steps insufficient for complex architecture

## Research Value

### Negative Result Significance
This failed validation paradoxically provides valuable insights:
1. **Validation importance**: Demonstrates need for robust evaluation pipelines
2. **Architecture limits**: Shows attention mechanisms aren't universally beneficial
3. **Complexity trade-offs**: Complex models can perform worse than simple ones
4. **Tool limitations**: Research tools must support experimental architectures

### Future Prevention
1. **Test validation compatibility** before long training runs
2. **Incremental complexity**: Add one component at a time
3. **Resolution priorities**: Focus on input resolution before architectural complexity
4. **Baseline validation**: Ensure simple approaches work before adding complexity

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Document failure mode** for future reference
2. **Fix validation script** to support new model types
3. **Move to resolution experiments** (1280×720)
4. **Abandon attention approach** for current resolution

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Prioritize resolution increase** over architectural complexity
2. **Validate tool compatibility** before complex experiments
3. **Maintain simple baseline** as fallback option
4. **Test attention mechanisms** only at higher resolutions

## Conclusion
While the validation failed technically, the available training-time metrics clearly indicate severe performance degradation. The 24.7% mAP (vs 34.08% baseline) represents a critical negative result that validates the importance of resolution over architectural complexity in event-based small object detection.

The validation failure itself provides additional research value by highlighting the importance of robust evaluation infrastructure and the risks of architectural over-engineering.
