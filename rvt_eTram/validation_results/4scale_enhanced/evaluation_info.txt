Performance Analysis:
--------------------
‚ùå UNEXPECTED RESULTS - Performance Degradation:

Class Categories by Size:
- Small (classes 2,3,4): Motorcycle, Bicycle, Pedestrian ‚Üí 14.83% mAP (WORSE than baseline)
- Medium/Large (classes 0,1,5,6,7): Car, Truck, Bus, Static, Other ‚Üí 30.97% mAP (WORSE than baseline)

Comparison with 3-scale Baseline:
- Overall mAP: 34.02% ‚Üí 30.93% (-3.09%)
- Small objects: 17.28% ‚Üí 14.83% (-2.45%)
- This contradicts our hypothesis that P1 features improve small object detection

Critical Analysis:
-----------------
üîç Why P1 Features May Have Hurt Performance:
1. **Increased Model Complexity**: More parameters without sufficient training
2. **Noisy High-Resolution Features**: P1 features may contain too much noise
3. **Training Strategy Mismatch**: Same training config may not suit larger model
4. **Feature Imbalance**: P1 features may overwhelm lower-resolution features
5. **Overfitting**: Additional parameters may have caused overfitting on small dataset

üî¨ Research Implications:
- P1 features alone are not sufficient for small object improvement
- Need additional strategies: size-aware loss, longer training, different architectures
- This negative result is valuable for understanding FPN limitations

Next Research Directions:
------------------------
1. Size-aware loss functions to properly weight small object contributions
2. Attention mechanisms specifically for small objects
3. Different training strategies for larger models
4. Analysis of P1 feature quality and noise levels
