3-Scale FPN Baseline Results Summary
=====================================

Experiment: 3-scale FPN Baseline
Date: 2025-07-08 05:00:32
Model: 3-scale FPN (strides: 8, 16, 32)
Dataset: etram_cls8_sample
Checkpoint: final_model.ckpt

Overall Performance:
-------------------
- mAP (IoU=0.50:0.95): 34.02%
- AP50 (IoU=0.50):     67.03%  
- AP75 (IoU=0.75):     30.79%
- Average Recall:      43.25%

Size-based Performance:
----------------------
ðŸ”´ Small objects:  17.28% mAP (classes 2,3,4: Motorcycle, Bicycle, Pedestrian)
   - AR: 30.90%
   - Primary improvement target

ðŸŸ¡ Medium objects: 34.03% mAP (classes 0,1,5,6,7: Car, Truck, Bus, Static, Other)
   - AR: 43.10%
   - Moderate performance

ðŸŸ¢ Large objects:  56.94% mAP (very large instances)
   - AR: 67.30%
   - Strong performance

Key Findings:
------------
1. Small object detection significantly underperforms (17.28% vs 34.02% overall)
2. This confirms the need for 4-scale FPN enhancement
3. Large objects perform well, indicating model capability is good
4. Target improvement: +15-25% for small objects with P1 features

Validation Details:
------------------
- Total iterations: 724
- Validation duration: 2:00 minutes
- Evaluation speed: 6.01 it/s
- No class-wise individual metrics available (limitation of current setup)

Next Steps:
----------
1. Implement 4-scale FPN (add P1 features at stride 4)
2. Compare small object performance improvement
3. Generate detailed class-wise metrics if possible
